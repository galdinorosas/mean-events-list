# Node-Events-list
---
### Application Description:             

  - I thought of this application because I enjoy listening to music live and I wanted to make it easier to search for events that I know I would like. 
  - Spotify API is used to collect the users followed artist list. Then Songkick API is used to collect each artist event within their future calender.
  - This app uses node.js and express.js to create a web server for this application.
  - Passport.js and passport-spotify strategy were used to set up the users Spotify login with Oauth authentification.
  - Google places API is used to get the coordinates of a searched city. The searched location coordinates are compared to the artist event coordinates.
